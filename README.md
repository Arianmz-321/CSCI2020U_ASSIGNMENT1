# Assignment 1 Spam Detector

## Project Information
This program helps to filter out spam emails. 
The program shows:
- name of email
- probability that the email is spam
- whether or not the email is actually spam, or ham (not spam)

Screenshots posted on github:
- Program displaying JSON output (top of page, middle of page, bottom of page)
- Program displaying ArrayList spamResult using command prompt
- Program displaying output for accuracy
- Program displaying output for precision

Other comments:
It appears there is an error with the calculations for accuracy and precision (issue has not been resolved yet)
The ArrayList spamResult shows the columns in correct order (name, probability that email is spam, actual class)
The JSON output is in the wrong order (issue has not been resolved yet)
